/**
  How many consecutive numbers are needed?

  Write a function that takes an array of unique integers and returns the minimum 
  number of integers needed to make the values of the array consecutive from the 
  lowest number to the highest number.

  Example
  [4, 8, 6] --> 2
  Because 5 and 7 need to be added to have [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

  [-1, -5] --> 3
  Because -2, -3, -4 need to be added to have [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]

  [1] --> 0
  []  --> 0

export function consecutive(array: number[]) {
  if (!array.length) return 0;
  let diff = Math.abs( Math.min(...array) - Math.max(...array) );
  return diff + 1 - array.length;
